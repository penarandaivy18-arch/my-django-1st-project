	While working on my project, I encountered an issue when trying to call the template file. The application was unable to display the correct page because I accidentally typed the wrong file name. I went over my code multiple times, checking line by line, but I couldnâ€™t figure out what was causing the issue. So I suspected there might be a larger issue with my setup. After closely examining the file paths and template calls, I finally discovered the typo in the file name. 

	Although it was a minor mistake, it had a significant impact on how the project operated. Even a single letter or character can make the difference between something working or breaking. This experience reminded me of the importance of accuracy and attention to detail in coding. This challenge taught me to be thorough and patient when debugging. I'll use this lesson to carefully double-check file names and paths in my future work.
